<h2 class="allytext2" >DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3 class="allytext" >Reading One</h3>
    <ol class="allytext"> 
        <li>Is incorporating the original purpose of the web back with what the web consists of today actually beneficial, or is there a new attitude/goal that we should try to aim for?</li>
        <li>In what ways can the web be utilized to create a more empathy-oriented way of connection? </li>
        <li>How can websites be used in collaboration with other mediums to produce a revival to the internet-attitude?</li>
    </ol>
<h3 class="allytext" >Reading Two</h3>
    <ol class="allytext"> 
        <li>How do we bring back a culture of human to human connectivity within the internet?</li>
        <li>Is scripting/leading users using “user experience design” to provide a seamless experience worth the loss of freedom to “narrate for oneself”? </li>
        <li>Will there be a point where transferring everything in normal life (from shoes/products/temperature/etc) to some sort of controllable software be detrimental to our growth as a human race?</li>
    </ol>
<h3 class="allytext" >Reading Three</h3>
    <ol class="allytext"> 
        <li>Can the method of “stealing DNA”  become something that is useful for society that doesn’t invade personal privacy?</li>
        <li>How can we, as students who want to encourage change, do better to be conscious and intentional of how we speak on the internet especially concerning the matters of talking about race? </li>
        <li>The article “Everyone Watches Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt Surveillance Theory” ends with the question ‘What is the solution for being constantly watched, if no one sees you at all?’. Going a step further, how do redirect the media to highlight different ethnicities and people groups in a natural and genuine way? And if there are companies currently trying to do that, how do we spread them to become more of the norm? 
        </li> </ol>
<h3 class="allytext" >Reading Four</h3>
    <ol class="allytext"> 
        <li>How has computers and the “web” culture that we currently have  personally changed your relationship that you have with others concerning genuinity and empathy ?</li>
        <li>Why has society continued to try to “make technology” to solve our problems rather than paying more attention to the “imperfections of man”? </li>
        <li>In the article “ethics and archiving the web”, Taeyoon states “I think the notion of trust comes into the spotlight here again, thinking about how can you can trust the anonymous systems. Then we begin considering how to redefine trust in a way where it’s beneficial for us to build stronger distributed responsibilities.” In what ways do we currently trust the system and how can those methods of trust be redefined to be better?

        </li> </ol>
    <h3 class="allytext" >Reading Five</h3>
    <ol class="allytext"> 
        <li>It is curious how Hito Steyerl explains how the quality of an image also contributes to the mise en scene of an image or media. In what ways do we see this in our own consumption of daily media?</li>
        <li>Rosa Menkman discusses how she feels “stuck in the membranes of knowledge, governed by social conventions and acceptances. As an artist she (I) strive to reposition these membranes; I do not feel locked into one medium…” etc. What are the positive and negative effects to using multiple mediums to convey meaning? </li>
        <li>Why has the idea of “a glitch” or rupture in the system become “something new and has become an ephemeral, personal experience”, and how can we as artists use that to our advantage??

        </li> </ol>
