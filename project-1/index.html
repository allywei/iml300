              you enter the warm coffee shop and set your umbrella to the side as you watch customers come and go. you take a deep breath and it smells like.. well.. coffee. but being back in a coffee shop after so long almost made you forget the satisfaction of the scent. </p>

             the rain pours outside as you take a seat. You let yourself close your eyes and let the calming atmosphere ease you as you wonder in awe that life exists like it does now - back to normal. you didn't think that there would be a day you could sit peacefully now that the quarantine and global pandemic is over.
